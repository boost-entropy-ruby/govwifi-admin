## Overview

The application allows users to perform the following tasks:

- Create an admin account.
- Invite team members to their account.
- View instructions on how to setup and configure GovWifi on their local network.
- Add IP addresses of their access points to the GovWifi system.
- View logs of authentication requests to GovWifi by IP address and username.

The application also includes a "Super Admin" login feature that allows a GDS administrator to:

- View all organisations signed up to GovWifi
- View all locations that use of GovWifi
- See specific information on each of these organisations

The application uses a few third party services, including:

The application also provides the following data for the RADIUS configuration via an S3 bucket:

- IP addresses.
- RADIUS secret keys
